# CryptoClustering
- My final files can be found in Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
- For the Module 11 Challenge we were tasked with using a cryptocurrency market data set that shows percent changes of various amounts of time. We had to scale the data then create new data frames based on the scaled data. Next we used the KMeans method to see an elbow curve to determine how many clusters we should be using to create our scatter plots.
- Finally we repeated the process I described above using the PCA model.
